## üßπ Data Preprocessing

### ‚úÖ Cleaning Steps
- **Missing Values**: Handle missing `previous_year_rating` entries through imputation or exclusion
- **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical variables to numeric format:
  - `gender`: Binary encoding (m=0, f=1)
  - `education`: Ordinal encoding (Below Secondary=0, Bachelor's=1, Master's & above=2)
  - `department`: Label encoding for 7 departments
  - `region`: Label encoding for 34 regions
  - `recruitment_channel`: Binary encoding (sourcing=0, other=1)

### üîç Before vs. After Encoding
**Before:**
```
department            object
region               object  
education            object
gender               object
recruitment_channel  object
```

**After:**
```
department            int64
region               int64
education            int64
gender               int64
recruitment_channel  int64
```

## üéØ Potential Use Cases

### 1. **Predictive Modeling**
- **Classification**: Predict promotion eligibility (binary classification)
- **Regression**: Estimate promotion timeline or performance scores
- **Clustering**: Identify employee segments with similar promotion patterns

### 2. **Business Intelligence**
